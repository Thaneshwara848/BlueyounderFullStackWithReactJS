{
	public int area()
        {
		return 1;
	}
}
public class Square extends Shape 
{
	public int area()
        {
		return 2;
	}
}
class Main() 
{
   public static void main(String[] args)
   {
	Shape shape = new Shape();
	Square square = new Square();
	shape = square;
	System.out.println(shape.area());
    }
}


a) Compilation failure
b) Runtime failure
c) 1
d) 2


ANS:D 


6_) What will be the output of the following Java code?

public class Shape 
{
	public int area()
        {
		return 1;
	}
}
public class Square extends Shape 
{
	public int area()
        {
		return 2;
	}
}
public class Rectangle extends Shape 
{
	public int area()
        {
		return 3;
	}
}
class Main() 
{
       public static void main(String[] args)
       {
	 Shape shape = new Shape();
	 Square square = new Square();
   	 Rectangle rect = new Rectangle();
	 rect = (Rectangle)square;
	 System.out.println(square.area());
	}
}


a) Compilation failure
b) 3
c) Runtime Exception
d) 2

Answer: a
Explanation: Interface cannot be instantiated. So we cannot create instances of shape.
